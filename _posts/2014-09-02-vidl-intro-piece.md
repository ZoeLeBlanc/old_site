Check out my [latest post](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/vidl/2014/09/zoe-leblanc-vidl-graduate-fellow-introductory-post)for the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning. This post was a bit tricky to write and it might be a bit tricky to read as it is more of a conceptual road map then an intro about me or my work. Nonetheless, hope you enjoy!

> Here’s a brief excerpt:
In 2007, Haruki Murakami, the great Japanese novelist, published my favorite type of book – the ones where writers talk about writing. The book, entitled What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, is a great read, full of philosophical musings; life lessons; and some really great quotes. My favorite is perhaps the most famous line from the book: “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”While Murakami was writing primarily about marathon running and the endurance needed to be a writer, I apply this same wisdom to my thoughts on digital learning.
