> Sometimes twitter can be useful.
For example, this past week after looking at the IHR digital history seminar page, I checked out their twitter stream [#dhist](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dhist&src=typd) and [@IHRDigHist](https://twitter.com/IHRDigHist), and found a tweet advertising a conference in Cambridge.

I was lucky enough to get a seat to attend Making Big Data Human, organized by Doing Public History at Cambridge University last week.

It's impossible to record everything we discussed, but Marta Musso storified the twitter exchange [here](https://instagram.com/p/7ZweZHJr8S/), which gives a good live feed of the conference.

In this post, I wanted to consider some of the questions and observations that have lingered since the conference around this intersection of big data and human/humane/humanities. Here are some of these thoughts in no particular order:

1. Where does digital history begin and big data end? Many of the speakers and participants in the conference almost immediately started slipping between the two terms. Are they truly synomymous though? I think the two certainly overlap but  how does big data alter your research
2. The incosistency of data > "patchiness of data collection" > relationship between uncertainty and big data > changes what types of knowledge claims we can make and how we talk about research unknowns > lack of knowledge > what is a webpage by James Baker
3. The bigness of data > "big data is all about complications"
4. data collection vs data curation > "unhook the data from the platform"
5. value of collaborations
6. Need to create standards of what is good digital history > dangers of close reading and chance > need robust sampling but impossible with unstructured data > transparency of data, problem or challenge?
7. Is digital history about tools, data or methods?
8. Ethics of big data? of aggregation?
9. Is digital history just a method of history like oral history or is it something else?
10. Standardization of databases of the future & future proofing data sets
11. How to tell stories with data visualizations?


Unlike most DH conferences, this one had a really diverse audience of historians, computer scientists, human geographers, corpus linguists, and many more. I think the diversity of the audience inspired a reoccuring conversation throughout the conference about the need to over come disciplinary lines. Though this is often easier said than done.

One of the highlights was a keynote address by Jane Winters, who runs the IHR's digital projects. 

Dangers of handling data
1. Black box phenomenon > too simplistic and decontextualized view of the data > tradeoff between scale and complexity/messiness of the data
2. Voices of humanists in tech development > "don't allow tech to determine tech", different light on old questions 
heavy emphasis on web archives
