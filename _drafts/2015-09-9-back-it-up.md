When I worked in a computer store before grad school, one of the most memorable customers was a PhD student whose laptop crashed. While crashed laptops were a staple at the store (*shakes fist at at you Toshiba, HP, and Dell*), he was memorable because of the sheer misery on his face because he didn't have a backup of his dissertation. 

I've known that pain too. My final year of undergrad, I essentially did the equivalent of drop kicking my laptop when I decided to watch the six hour BBC version of Pride and Prejudice while my laptop ominously clicked away. [^1] 

**So how to avoid this wretched fate?**

Well, I have some thoughts about how I've learned to back up my data and hopefully you'll find them helpful for your needs.

>First, thing you need to realize is that there is no one template for how to create a smart data backup system.[^2] 

That being said, I do think there is a way to be more mindful about why and how you backup your data. In grad school, we talk a lot about research questions and methods, but never about research work flow. [See post] This omission is quickly becoming a problem as more and more historians are using digital cameras and scanners. These tools are letting us gather big data sets but most of us are ill equipped on how to deal with a terabyte or two of pictures. I've had my computer get so overloaded with data that there wasn't even enough short term data to run programs. 

My solution involved considering a number of factors:

* Cost. I wanted as cheap a solution possible.
* Redundicies. I wanted to be sure that I had enough duplicates in both cloud and physical form that I would never experience data lost.
* East of transferring/accessing data. I wanted a solution that did not take months to load the data to a cloud service, and would allow me to transfer data between multiple OS.
* Keep data in raw form. I wanted to make sure that my data was kept as raw as possible so that if certain programs became obsolete I could always access all my materials. 

Some things I decided I didn't need were the ability to edit my data, whether docs or pics, in the cloud, and I didn't need a file management system. Essentially I wanted a complete copy of my data as I had organized it. 

While having a clear picture helped, I still found it difficult to decide which solution was best for me, especially in regards to cloud solutions. For external hard drives, I've always liked the W Passports, as they were more reliable when I worked at the computer store than Seagate or Lacie. I would ideally like to get a solid state but I'm waiting a year or two for the price to drop and the storage size to increase. If you have the money, solid state is the way to go though.

    Amazon Cloud Drive unlimited data storage for $59.99/year
    Google Drive 15GB free or 1TB/user for $10/month
    Dropbox 2GB free or 1TB for $9.99/month
    Amazon S3 free tier for 5GB 1 year or $0.3/GB per month
    Amazon Glacier $0.1/GB per month + $0.05/GB in per request fees

At the moment, the undisputed leader in cloud storage is Amazon Web Services. However, AWS is really more geared towards large scale business solutions, so for some the difficulty of using AWS is too high of a barrier. If you want a service that let's you edit documents in the cloud, then Google Drive is really the obvious choice. But for most hitorians, we just need somewhere to put our photos until we're using them in either a database or text analysis. 

I decided to use a combination of AWS Glacier and S3. A big factor in my choice was the upload speed, which is significantly faster than the Dropbox Pro I was using before. The cost was also a big factor, since I prefer to pay for what I use and at the moment I pay something like $8 a month to store all my data.

The one downside of AWS is the lack of user interface. While I'm pretty comfortable

[^1]: By the way if you hear a clicking noise from your laptop, immediately shut it down and take it in to a store to get the data removed and your hard drive replaced. Or skip all this fear and just buy a solid state drive.
[^2]: In this post, I'm breaking apart data backup from data management. I realize the two are pretty intertwined but for sake of space and clarity, I'm only going to try and tackle the former.
