# Hi! I'm Zoe.

###[Academia Bio](#academiabio) | ###[Teaching](#teaching)


I'm an aspiring digital historian, who studies networks, ideas, and spaces in modern history. I specialize in American, Middle Eastern, and North African histories, and consider myself an international historian. I like thinking about race and religion, especially from the perspective of institutions and states. 

Things that fascinate me (in no particular order):

* The resurgence of religion in the second half of the twentieth century across the globe
* The relationship(s) between states and social movements
* The power of ideas and ideologies to naturalize and denaturalize 
* The relationship(s) between space and time for constituting place
* The rise of 'health' as a discourse in the second half of the twentieth century
* The use of probablistic statistics to understand historical discourses and events
* The relationship(s) between local, national, and international
* The potential for technology to augment historical research

These are all I can think of at the moment, but there's many more questions that I like to spend my day stewing over. 

At the moment, I'm a Canadian expat who is lucky enough to call Nashville, TN home while I complete my doctorate in history at Vanderbilt Univeristy. I'm not a huge country music fan, but I've learned to appreciate good musicians - especially if they know how to rock on a banjo. I'm a big fan of public radio and broadcasting, and love trying new software and hardware (my home desk has been dubbed the tech graveyard).

Some of things I'm working on at the moment include:

* Researching my dissertation
* Improving my programming skills (specifically python and ruby)
* Building websites
* Practicing Arabic 
* Learning how to build deep maps
* Thinking about digital pedagogy

Feel free to drop me a line via twitter or my contact page, and I'll try and get back to you quickly. I'm happy to talk about my research, potential collaborations, or the virtues of ice cream and nutella.
